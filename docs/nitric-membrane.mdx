## Architecture

The Nitric Membrane runs alongside your code as a separate process or side-car container, insulating application code from proprietary request/response formats and APIs. The process provides a Gateway server which accepts incoming triggers such as HTTP Requests, Events, etc., translates them into a standard trigger format and forwards them to your Compute [Service](./services)/[Function](./services-functions). The Gateway also accepts a standard response format from your application and serializes it into an appropriate format based on the initial request.

The Membrane also acts as a server for the [Unified APIs](./nitric-apis) offered by Nitric (such as [Events](./events), [Queues](./queues), etc.), which are implemented via cloud provider specific plugins. Application code interacts with these services via gRPC, either directly or via a language [SDK](./sdks), enabling complete freedom in terms of the language or runtime used to develop applications.

By wrapping both in-bound and out-bound communication in this way, the Membrane ensures maximum portability of applications via an intuitive set of services and APIs. The plugin based architecture ensures new and varied provider services can continue to be safely added without breaking application code.

## Usage & Installation

When building new Compute [Services](./services) or [Functions](./services-functions) based on official Nitric Templates, the Membrane and typically one of the official SDKs will be pre-installed and configured. There is no additional configuration or authentication required to interact with the Membrane, or the APIs it offers.

If you'd like to explore other installation options or require more advanced configuration, instructions are provided on the [Membrane GitHub Project](https://github.com/nitrictech/membrane).
