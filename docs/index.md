Nitric is a framework for rapid Cloud and Serverless application development.

It offers portable building blocks for building on AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Nitric is opinionated to help you move super fast, but flexible and composable for when things need to get custom.

## How does it work?

Nitric is a little unique in the way it builds and deploys projects. Reading the [concepts](./docs/concepts) section can be a good way to learn more.
