Nitric provides SDKs/Libraries for many languages to assist in developing Serverless Functions and interacting with the Nitric APIs.

## Official SDKs

| **Runtime** | **Languages**          | **Status** | **Links**                                                                                                               |

## Installation

In most instances, you won't need to manually download or add these SDKs as dependencies of your projects. When creating new [Serverless Functions](./services-functions) and other [Services](./services) with Nitric, the relevant SDK/Dependency will be included by default in those assets based on the Template chosen.

In the case where you're creating your own template or using Nitric in a custom project, you can add the relevant SDKs following the instructions found in their `README` files on GitHub.

## Learning

Again, most of the time you won't need to learn an SDK in isolation. Instead, examples and instructions are provided in the relevant documentation for the [services](./nitric-apis) and functionality provided by Nitric, with examples in supported languages that use the SDKs above. If you'd like to look at documentation for a specific SDK, try one of the `docs` links above or explore an SDK on GitHub.

## Need another language or runtime?

The Nitric team focuses our efforts where we see demand, if we're missing a Language/Runtime that you need for your next project [come chat!](https://community.nitric.io) In the meantime, all Nitric SDKs interact with our [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) based APIs, code generation exists for most [languages supported by gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/). We provide a set of [Protocol Buffer contracts](https://github.com/nitrictech/contracts) which can be used with those code generation tools to generate your own API client code.
