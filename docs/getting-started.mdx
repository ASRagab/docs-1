After installing the [Nitric CLI](/docs/installation), you can start building a project.

### Using the `new` command

The Nitric CLI's `new` command provides prompts to scaffold new projects from templates. In this example we'll select the TypeScript starter template. The CLI also needs to know which source files represent your application code. In this example all of our app code is inside the `functions/` folder, so we provide a glob pattern to match that folder.

```bash
nitric new
? What is the name of the stack? hello-world
? Choose a template: official/TypeScript - Starter
? Glob for the function handlers? functions/*.ts
```

Navigate to the new project directory and install the NPM dependencies:

```bash
cd hello-world

npm install
```

Your project should now look like this:

```txt
+--functions/
|  +-- hello.ts
+--node_modules/
|  ...
+--package-lock.json
+--package.json
+--README.md
```

### Running your app

The Nitric CLI can run your application locally for development and testing.

```bash
nitric run
```

Output:

```txt
 SUCCESS  Configuration gathered (2s)
 SUCCESS  Created Dev Image! (0s)
 SUCCESS  Started Local Services! (2s)
 SUCCESS  Started Functions! (0s)
Local running, use ctrl-C to stop

Api  | Endpoint
main | http://localhost:9001/apis/main
```

Take a look in the `hello.ts` file, you'll see it declares an API named `main` with a single route `GET /hello/:name`.

When running locally Nitric hosts all your APIs under the path:

```txt
http://localhost:9001/apis/[api_name]/
```

in this case the URL for the API is:

```txt
http://localhost:9001/apis/main/
```

You can test the API using cURL, your browser, or any other HTTP client:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9001/apis/main/hello/John
Hello John
```

### Making updates

The run command supports hot reload by default, so let's make some changes and see what happens.

Open `functions/hello.ts` in your editor and add a new route to the API, then save the file:

```typescript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk';

const helloApi = api('main');

helloApi.get('/hello/:name', async (ctx) => {
  const { name } = ctx.req.params;
  ctx.res.body = `Hello ${name}`;
  return ctx;
});

// add this
helloApi.get('/goodbye/:name', async (ctx) => {
  const { name } = ctx.req.params;
  ctx.res.body = `Goodbye ${name}`;
  return ctx;
});
```

After saving, the new route will be registered and you can test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9001/apis/main/goodbye/John
Goodbye John
```

When you're finished running press `ctrl + c` to stop the run command.

## Deploying the app

Now that you've implemented a basic API and tested that it works, you can deploy it to one of the major cloud platforms.

The first step is to set up your credentials for the cloud provider.

- [AWS](/docs/reference/aws)
- [Azure](/docs/reference/azure)
- [GCP](/docs/reference/gcp)

You'll then need to create a [stack](/docs/reference/stacks) which represents your project and a deployment target.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

Follow the prompts to create a stack for your provider, this example will use `aws`.

```
? What do you want to call your new stack? dev
? Which Cloud do you wish to deploy to? aws
? select the region us-east-1
```

Now you can deploy your stack named `dev` with the `up` command.

```bash
nitric up -s dev
```

Output:

```
 SUCCESS  Configuration gathered (2s)
 SUCCESS  Images built (3s)
 Deployed  Function/hello (15)
 Deployed  Stack (25s)
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| API  | Endpoint                                               |
| main | https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com |
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API.

To undeploy this stack -

```bash
nitric down -s dev
```
