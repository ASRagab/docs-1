After installing the [Nitric CLI](/docs/installation), you can start building a project.

### Using the `new` command

The Nitric CLI's `new` command provides prompts to scaffold new projects from templates. In this example we'll select the TypeScript starter template:

```bash
nitric new
? What is the name of the stack? hello-world
? Choose a template: official/TypeScript - Starter
```

Navigate to the new project directory and install the NPM dependencies:

```bash
cd hello-world

npm install
```

Your project should now look like this:

```txt
+--functions/
|  +-- hello.ts
+--node_modules/
|  ...
+--package-lock.json
+--package.json
+--README.md
```

### Running your app

The Nitric CLI can run your application locally for development and testing. The run command needs to know which source files represent your application code. In this example all of our app code is inside the `functions/` folder, so we provide a glob pattern to match that folder.

```bash
nitric run ./functions/*.ts
```

Output:

```txt

+-----------------+------------------------------------+

Local running, use ctrl-C to stop

Api  | Endpoint
main | http://localhost:9001/apis/main
```

Take a look in the `hello.ts` file, you'll see it declares an API named `main` with a single route `GET /hello/:name`.

When running locally Nitric hosts all your APIs under the path:

```txt
http://localhost:9001/apis/[api_name]/
```

in this case the URL for the API is:

```txt
http://localhost:9001/apis/main/
```

You can test the API using cURL, your browser, or any other HTTP client:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9001/apis/main/hello/John
Hello John
```

### Making updates

The run command supports hot reload by default, so let's make some changes and see what happens.

Open `functions/hello.ts` in your editor and add a new route to the API, then save the file:

```typescript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk';

const helloApi = api('main');

helloApi.get('/hello/:name', async (ctx) => {
  const { name } = ctx.req.params;
  ctx.res.body = `Hello ${name}`;
  return ctx;
});

// add this
helloApi.get('/goodbye/:name', async (ctx) => {
  const { name } = ctx.req.params;
  ctx.res.body = `Goodbye ${name}`;
  return ctx;
});
```

After saving, the new route will be registered and you can test it:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9001/apis/main/goodbye/John
Goodbye John
```

When you're finished running press `ctrl + c` to stop the run command.

## Deploying the app

Now that you've implemented a basic API and tested that it works, you can deploy it to one of the major cloud platforms.

The first step is to set up your credentials for the cloud provider. You can follow along in the [provider overview]('/reference/aws').

You can then deploy by specifying the source files to build and the targeted provider:

```bash
nitric deployment apply functions/*.ts --provider aws
# OR
nitric deployment apply functions/*.ts --provider gcp
# OR
nitric deployment apply functions/*.ts --provider azure
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API.
