## Project set up

After you have installed the Nitric cli, you can start building a project.

Create a new folder and initialize a node project.

```
npm init
```

Add the nitric sdk.

```
npm install @nitric/sdk

or

yarn add @nitric/sdk
```

Add a folder to put your functions into, and add a file to start building. Your project should now look like:

```
node_modules/
|-- ...
functions/
|-- hello.ts
package.json
yarn.lock
```

## Building the App

Lets build a simple API that will greet a user.

Start by creating a new `api` object in `hello.ts`

```typescript
import { api } from '@nitric/sdk';

const helloApi = api('greeter');
```

We can then map functions to the routes of the API. These routes will match on the specified HTTP method.

```typescript
helloApi.get('/hello/:name', (ctx) => {
  const { name } = ctx.req.params;

  ctx.res.body = `Hello ${name}`;

  return ctx;
});
```

This particular endpoint will match on any GET requests to `/greeter/hello/:name`, name being a parameter. It pulls the name from the request parameters, writes to the response body and returns the context.

Thus, we would expect this to return 'Hello nitric' if a we routed to `/greeter/hello/nitric`.

## Testing the App

We can then test it locally using the Nitric cli.

```
nitric run functions/hello.ts
```

This will start the necessary application containers as well as the gateway that will route our request to the container.

```
> curl localhost:9001/greeter/hello/nitric

Hello nitric
```


## Deploying the app

Now that we've implemented a basic API and tested that it works, we can deploy it to any of the major cloud platforms.

The first step for this is to set up the credentials for your chosen cloud platform. You can follow along in the [provider overview]('/reference/aws').

You can then deploy by specifying the handler location and the provider.

```
nitric deployment apply functions/hello.ts --provider aws

nitric deployment apply functions/hello.ts --provider gcp

nitric deployment apply functions/hello.ts --provider azure
```

You can then go to your cloud dashboard and you'll be able to see and interact with your API.
