## What we'll do

1. Use Nitric to create an API to create and update profiles
2. Create handlers for the following API operations

| **Method** | **Route**              | **Description**                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `GET`      | /profiles/{$profileId} | Get a specific profile by its Id |
| `GET`      | /profiles              | List all profiles                |
| `POST`     | /profiles              | Create a new profile             |
| `DELETE`   | /profiles/{$profileId} | Delete a profile                 |
| `PUT`      | /profiles/{$profileId} | Update a profile                 |

3. Running locally for testing
4. Deploy to a cloud of your choice

## Getting started

This tutorial assumes you have the Nitric CLI installed, if not you can follow the [installation guide](/docs/installation).

### New project

Weâ€™ll start by creating a new project for our API.

```bash
nitric new
```

Create a project name and select the TypeScript template.

```text
? What is the name of the stack? my-profile-api
? Choose a template: official/TypeScript - Starter
```

Next, open the project in your editor of choice.

```bash
> cd my-profile-api
```

Make sure all dependencies are resolved with yarn or npm.

```bash
yarn install
```

The scaffolded project should have the following structure:

```text
+--functions/
|  +-- hello.ts
+--node_modules/
|  ...
+--package.json
+--README.md
```

You can test the project scaffold with the `run` command.

```bash
nitric run
```

> The first time you run a project or function it will take a moment longer to start while Docker image layers are downloaded and cached on your machine.

```bash
SUCCESS  Configuration gathered (3s)
SUCCESS  Created Dev Image! (1s)
SUCCESS  Started Local Services! (2s)
SUCCESS  Started Functions!(0s)

Local running, use ctrl-C to stop

Api  | Endpoint
main | http://localhost:9001/apis/main
```

The template project is successfully scaffolded.

## Coding our Profile API

Let's start by initializing our profiles api, create a file named 'profiles.ts' within functions and add the following code.

Here we are defining the following -

- an API named public,
- a collection named profiles with reading/writing permissions

```typescript
import { api, collection } from '@nitric/sdk';

// Create a secure api
const profileApi = api('public');

// Access profile collection with permissions
const profiles = collection('profiles').for('writing', 'reading');
```

### Add uuidv4 to your project

```bash
> yarn add uuidv4
```

> Import uuid, so that we can create profiles against an ID.

```
import { uuid } from "uuidv4";
```

### Now we'll start adding our REST Methods

> Create profile with a post method

```typescript
profileApi.post('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  let name = ctx.req.json().name;
  let age = ctx.req.json().age;
  let homeTown = ctx.req.json().homeTown;
  let id = uuid();

  // Create the new profile
  await profiles.doc(id).set({ name, age, homeTown, id });

  // Return the id
  ctx.res.json({
    msg: `Profile with id ${id} created.`,
  });
});
```

> Retrieve profile with a get method

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id'];

  // Return the profile
  try {
    const profile = await profiles.doc(id).get();
    return ctx.res.json(profile);
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404;
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    });
  }
});
```

> Retrieve all profiles with a get method

```typescript
profileApi.get('/profiles', async (ctx) => {
  // Return all profiles
  return ctx.res.json({
    output: await profiles.query().fetch(),
  });
});
```

> Remove profile with a delete method

```typescript
profileApi.delete('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id'];

  // Delete the profile
  try {
    const profile = await profiles.doc(id).delete();
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} deleted.`,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404;
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    });
  }
});
```

> Update profile with a put method

```typescript
profileApi.put('/profiles/:id', async (ctx) => {
  const id = ctx.req.params['id'];
  const profile = profiles.doc(id);
  try {
    const current = await profile.get();

    let name = ctx.req.json().name ?? current['name'] ?? '';
    let age = ctx.req.json().age ?? current['age'] ?? '';
    let homeTown = ctx.req.json().homeTown ?? current['homeTown'] ?? '';

    // Create or Update the profile
    await profile.set({ name, age, homeTown });
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} updated.`,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    ctx.res.status = 404;
    ctx.res.json({
      msg: `Profile with id ${id} not found.`,
    });
  }
});
```

Nitric will automatically infer the required specification and permissions to create an API Gateway - [Learn more](/docs/concepts).

## Run it!

Now that you have an API defined with handlers for each of its methods, it's time to test it out locally.

Try out your application with the `run` command:

```bash
nitric run
```

> _Note:_ `run` starts a container to act as an API gateway, as well as a container for each of the services.

```
 SUCCESS Configuration gathered (3s)
 SUCCESS  Created Dev Image! (2s)
 SUCCESS  Started Local Services! (2s)
 SUCCESS  Started Functions! (1s)
Local running, use ctrl-C to stop

Api    | Endpoint
public | http://localhost:9001/apis/public
```

Once it starts, the application will receive requests via the API port. You can use cURL, Postman or any other HTTP client to test the API.

You can use ctrl-C to end the application.

try out the following commands with curl or postman.

Create Profile- POST - http://127.0.0.1:9001/apis/public/profiles

```json
{
  "name": "Peter Parker",
  "age": "21",
  "homeTown": "Queens"
}
```

Fetch Profile - GET - http://127.0.0.1:9001/apis/public/profiles/{id}

Fetch All Profiles - GET - http://127.0.0.1:9001/apis/public/profiles/

Update Profile - PUT - http://127.0.0.1:9001/apis/public/profiles/{id}

```json
{
  "name": "Ben Reily",
  "homeTown": "Las Vegas"
}
```

Delete Profile - DELETE - http://127.0.0.1:9001/apis/public/profiles/{id}

## Deploy to the cloud

Setup your credentials and any other cloud specific configuration:

- [AWS](/docs/reference/aws)
- [Azure](/docs/reference/azure)

Run the appropriate deployment command

> Warning: Publishing services to the cloud may incur costs.

AWS

```bash
nitric deployment apply functions/*.ts --provider aws

```

Azure

```bash
nitric deployment apply functions/*.ts --provider azure
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API.

To undeploy run the following command.

```bash
nitric deployment delete
```
