This guide describes how to add JWT middleware to your REST API and is a continuation of the [REST API guide](/docs/guides/rest-api).

> Note: Middleware is currently only available with the [Nitric Node-SDK](https://github.com/nitrictech/node-sdk)

## What we'll do

1. Install the JWT Middleware to our existing API Stack
2. Add basic JWT validation and scope verification using a HS256 secret

## Install the middleware

```bash
npm install @nitric/middleware-jwt

# OR

yarn add @nitric/middleware-jwt
```

## Validating JWTs
