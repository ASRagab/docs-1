# Topics

## Overview

A topic is a named target to which events can be published. They can be thought of as a subject that your functions can discuss with each other.

They're awesome for allowing serverless functions to communicate in a stateless and highly decoupled way.

## Events

Events are the messages that can be published to a topic. They can be thought of as kind of notification that is sent to raise that something new has happened.

## Subscriptions

A subscription is something listening to a topic. You can think of it as a channel that notifies your application when something new arrives on the topic.

## A Practical Example

TODO: Hypothetical example of usefulness of topics (e.g. an order system that dispatches orders for fulfillment and shipping, that can be extended to do customer notifications later).
