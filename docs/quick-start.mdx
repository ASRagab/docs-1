In this Quick Start guide you will be creating two nitric services that communicate with each other via a topic, and are invoked via an API


## Creating a Nitric Project

The Nitric CLI provides helper commands to create [projects](./projects) and the resources that define them. Using the `make:project` command, will guide you through the creation of an initial Nitric project.

```bash
nitric make:project my-project
```

You'll be asked whether you'd like to include an initial service in the project. Select the service runtime of your choice:

```bash
? Include an example service? (Use arrow keys)
❯ function/golang15 
  function/python37 
  function/nodejs12 
  function/nodets12 
  function/java11 
  server/nextjs-typescript
  none 
```

Next, you'll be asked for a name for the service. Once that's provided the project and initial service will be scaffolded, along with the `nitric.yaml` project configuration file.

```bash
? Service name my-service
✔ Making Project my-project
✔ Making Service my-service

cd ./my-project
```

The initial `nitric.yaml` file should contain your project name and the initial service definition:

```yaml
name: my-first-project
services:
  my-service:
    path: my-service
    runtime: function/nodets12
```

## Test it out

You can run and test your project locally using the Nitric CLI `run` command:

```bash
nitric run
```
> Your initial run may take some time to build your services, subsequent runs will be faster once dependencies have been cached.

Once built and running you should see the following output
```bash
✔ Staging stack hello-nitric
✔ Building Services 
✔ Creating docker network
✔ Creating Volume: hello-nitric-vol
✔ Running Services
Service					Port  
my-service			       <port> 
Services Running press ctrl-C quit...
```

Try invoking your service

> Services are allocated ports on your local machine. Substitute the port number below with the port provided in the output of the `run` command.

```bash
	curl http://localhost:<port>
```
