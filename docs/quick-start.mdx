In this Quick Start guide you will be creating two nitric services that communicate with each other via a topic, and are invoked via an API

## Creating a Nitric Project

The Nitric CLI provides helper commands to create [projects](./projects) and the resources that define them. Using the `make:project` command, will guide you through the creation of an initial Nitric project.

```bash
nitric make:project my-project
```

You'll be asked whether you'd like to include an initial service in the project. Select the service runtime of your choice:

```bash
? Include an example service? (Use arrow keys)
❯ function/nodets12
  function/nodejs12
  function/python37
  function/java11
  function/golang15
  server/nextjs-typescript
  none
```

Next, you'll be asked for a name for the service. Once that's provided the project and initial service will be scaffolded, along with the `nitric.yaml` project configuration file.

```bash
? Name for the example service? my-service
✔ Making Project my-project
✔ Making Service my-service

cd ./my-project
```

The initial `nitric.yaml` file should contain your project name and the initial service definition:

```yaml
name: my-project
services:
  my-service:
    path: my-service
    runtime: function/nodets12
```

## Test it out

You can run and test your project locally using the Nitric CLI `run` command:

```bash
nitric run
```

> Your initial run may take some time to build your services, subsequent runs will be faster once dependencies have been cached.

Once built and running you should see the following output

```bash
✔ Building Services
✔ Creating docker network
✔ Creating Volume: my-project-vol
✔ Running Services
✔ Starting API Gateways
✔ Starting Entrypoints
Service    Port
my-service 49152
Running, press 'Q' to clean up and exit...
```

Try invoking your service

> Services are allocated ports on your local machine. Substitute the port number below with the port provided in the output of the `run` command.

```bash
	curl http://localhost:<port>
```
