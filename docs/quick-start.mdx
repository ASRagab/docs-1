In this Quick Start guide you will be creating two nitric functions that communicate with each other via a topic, and are invoked via an API


## Creating a Nitric Project

The Nitric CLI provides helper commands to create [projects](./projects) and the resources that define them. Using the `make:project` command, will guide you through the creation of an initial Nitric project.

```bash
nitric make:project my-project
```

You'll be asked whether you'd like to include an initial function in the project. Select the function runtime of your choice:

```bash
? Include an example function? (Use arrow keys)
❯ official/golang15 
  official/python37 
  official/nodejs12 
  official/nodets12 
  official/java11 
  none 
```

Next, you'll be asked for a name for the function. Once that's provided the project and initial function will be scaffolded, along with the `nitric.yaml` project configuration file.

```bash
? Function name my-function
✔ Making Project my-project
✔ Making Function my-function

cd ./my-project
```

The initial `nitric.yaml` file should contain your project name and the initial function definition:

```yaml
name: my-first-project
functions:
  - name: my-first-function
    path: my-first-function
    runtime: official/nodets12
```

## Test it out

You can run and test your project locally using the Nitric CLI `run` command:

```bash
nitric run
```
> Your initial run may take some time to build your functions, subsequent runs will be faster once dependencies have been cached.

Once built and running you should see the following output
```bash
✔ Staging stack hello-nitric
✔ Building Functions 
✔ Creating docker network
✔ Creating Volume: hello-nitric-vol
✔ Running Functions
Function					Port  
my-first-function			<port> 
Functions Running press ctrl-C quit...
```

Try invoking your function

> Functions are allocated ports on your local machine. Substitute the port number below with the port provided in the output of the `run` command.

```bash
	curl http://localhost:<port>
```
