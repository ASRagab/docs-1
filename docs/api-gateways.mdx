Nitric provides a standard way to define an API via the [Open API 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) specification to 
simplify the deployment of a managed API Gateway for your Nitric services, unlocking the benefits of those managed API Gateway services such as monitoring, scale, authentication, tracing, etc.

By default, services (such as serverless functions) in a Nitric application aren't exposed publicly when they're deployed to a cloud provider. Instead, they can to be exposed via an [entrypoint](./entrypoints) and/or an API.

## How does it work

Nitric uses the standard Open API spec with well-defined extensions `x-nitric-target`, that are defined at the operation level of the spec.

Example extension definition:
```yaml
x-nitric-target:
	name: my-service-name
	type: service
```

> Currently, only [services](./services) are supported as targets for Nitric APIs

## Defining an API

To add an API to an existing application, create or update the `apis` section of the project `nitric.yaml`. The following is an example of a simple API for a GET request to an example function.

```yaml
services:
	example:
		path: example
		runtime: function/nodets12

apis:
	example:
    openapi: 3.0.0
    info:
      version: 1.0.0
      title: Sample API
      description: A sample API to illustrate OpenAPI concepts
    paths:
      /exampleapi/example:
        get:
          operationId: quote
          # ðŸ‘€ Note the use of extension here to target the
          # service defined above
          x-nitric-target:
            name: example
            type: service
          description: Says random quote             
          responses:
            '200':
              description: Successful response
```

### Binding API operations to services

In the above example, the API operation `GET: /exampleapi/example` has been bound to a nitric function using an `x-nitric-target` property on the operation. The result of this configuration is that all HTTP requests to `GET: /exampleapi/example` will be forwarded to the `example` function from the API Gateway once deployed.

The x-nitric-target extension consists of the following properties:

| Property | Value    | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| -------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | `string` | The name of another resource in the stack definition, such as a service. Requests to the API operation will be forwarded to this resource to be processed.             |
| type     | `string` | The type of resource used for this target. This value must match a supported top level resource type in the stack definition. Currently supported values are: `service` |


## Testing your API

The easiest way to test your API is running it locally.

`nitric run`

In the output you should see the local port mapping for your configured APIs:
```
Api         Port
<api-name>  <port>
```

This will be accessible via `localhost`, you can try invoking your API using curl, or an API testing tool such as postman.

Curl example for above definition using nitric run:
`curl http://localhost:<port>`
