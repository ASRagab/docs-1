Nitric's API Gateway resource provides a convenient option for configuring and deploying RESTful APIs in front of your application's [Service](./services)/[Functions](./services-functions). These APIs are then deployed to the managed API Gateway services of each supported cloud provider to ensure their reliability, scalability and security.

APIs are defined using [Open API 3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/) specifications, ensuring they conform to a standard shared by many providers.

To improve application security, the [Services](./services) in a Nitric application aren't exposed publicly when they're deployed to a cloud provider. Instead, they can to be exposed via an [Entrypoint](./entrypoints) an API or both. When combining related [Functions](./services-functions) into a cohesive API, an API Gateway is often the best choice to aggregate these services, secure them and map their behavior onto API paths and HTTP Methods.

## How it works

Nitric uses the standard Open API spec with well-defined `x-nitric-target` extensions, that are included at the operation level of the spec.

Example extension definition:

```yaml
x-nitric-target:
	name: my-service-name
	type: service
```

> Currently, only [Services](./services) _(including Functions)_ are supported as targets for Nitric APIs

## Defining an API

To add an API to an existing application, create or update the `apis` section of the project stack definition, e.g. `nitric.yaml`. The following is an example of a simple API for a GET request to an `example` function.

```yaml
services:
	example:
		path: example
		runtime: function/nodets12

apis:
	example:
        openapi: 3.0.0
        info:
          version: 1.0.0
          title: Sample API
          description: A sample API to illustrate OpenAPI concepts
        paths:
          /exampleapi/example:
            get:
              operationId: quote
              # ðŸ‘€ Note the use of extension here to target the
              # service defined above
              x-nitric-target:
                name: example
                type: service
              description: Says random quote
              responses:
                '200':
                  description: Successful response
```

### Binding API operations to services

In the above example, the API operation `GET: /exampleapi/example` has been bound to a nitric function using an `x-nitric-target` property on the operation. The result of this configuration is that all HTTP requests to `GET: /exampleapi/example` will be forwarded to the `example` function from the API Gateway once deployed.

The x-nitric-target extension consists of the following properties:

| Property | Value    | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | `string` | The name of another resource in the stack definition, such as a service. Requests to the API operation will be forwarded to this resource to be processed.              |
| type     | `string` | The type of resource used for this target. This value must match a supported top level resource type in the stack definition. Currently supported values are: `service` |

## Testing your API

The easiest way to test your API is running it locally.

```bash
nitric run
```

In the output you should see the local port mapping for your configured APIs:

```
Api         Port
<api-name>  <port>
```

This will be accessible via `localhost`, you can try invoking your API using curl, or an API testing tool such as postman.

Curl example for above definition using nitric run:
`curl http://localhost:<port>`
