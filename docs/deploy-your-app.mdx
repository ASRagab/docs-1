This guide demonstrates using the CLI to deploy your Nitric app.
Try [Nitric Deploy](https://deploy.nitric.io) for a 'push-to-deploy' experience.

## Deploying your app

The first step is to set up your credentials for the cloud provider.

- [AWS](/docs/reference/aws)
- [Azure](/docs/reference/azure)
- [GCP](/docs/reference/gcp)

For AWS, you'll do this by setting up a credentials file, GCP and Azure will require you to install their CLI and login.

You'll then need to create a [stack](/docs/reference/stacks) which represents your project and a deployment target.

```bash
nitric stack new
```

Follow the prompts to create a stack for your provider, this example will use `aws`.

```
? What do you want to call your new stack? dev
? Which Cloud do you wish to deploy to? aws
? select the region us-east-1
```

Now you can deploy your stack with the `up` command.

```bash
nitric up
```

Output:

```
 SUCCESS  Configuration gathered (2s)
 SUCCESS  Images built (3s)
 Deployed  Function/hello (15)
 Deployed  Stack (25s)
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
| API  | Endpoint                                               |
| main | https://XXXXXXXX.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com |
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

When the deployment is complete, go to the relevant cloud console and you'll be able to see and interact with your API.

To undeploy this stack -

```bash
nitric down
```
