description: How to integrate nitric with your Pulumi setup
---

Nitric's cloud deployments are built on a pluggable interface known as [providers](). All of Nitric's core providers [aws](), [gcp]() and [azure]() are powered by [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com). When using these providers you can [integrate nitric into your existing Pulumi setup](), as easily as you could with your own Pulumi programs.

You can also extend these providers using the Pulumi automation API to write your own Nitric providers.
