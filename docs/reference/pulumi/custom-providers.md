title: Building Nitric providers using Pulumi
description: Create your own Infrastructure from Code experience with deployments powered by Pulumi

If you're not already familiar with the basics of nitric providers detailed overview on how nitric providers work under the hood can be found [here](../providers/custom/building-custom-provider.md).

Nitric's providers are simple programs that implement a plugin interface backed by gRPC. A nitric provider is a simple server that will be started by the nitric CLI at deploy time and will be provided with a cloud specification to deploy any way the provider sees fit.

Nitric providers can be written using any language, but for now we'd recommend using Go to make use of existing nitric pulumi custom resources and generated protobuf contracts in the nitric core repository.

A simple gRPC deployment server, that include pulumi automation API references to get started

```go
type DeployServer struct {
}

func (d *DeployServer) Up(request *deploy.DeployUpRequest, stream deploy.DeployService_UpServer) error {
    // Nitric provides details such as stack and project name on the request, but you're free to change these up to suit your needs
    pulumiStack, err := auto.UpsertStackInlineSource(context.TODO(), "<your_stack_name>", "<you_stack_project>", func(ctx *pulumi.Context) error {
        // ðŸ‘‡ Your pulumi program goes here...
        for _, res := range request.Spec.Resources {
            // Requested resources are provided as part of the deployment request
        }
    })

    if err != nil {
		return err
	}

    res, err := pulumiStack.Up(context.TODO(), optup.ProgressStreams(messageWriter))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}

    // send final results
    // err = stream.Send(...)

	return err
}

func (d *DeployServer) Down(request *deploy.DeployDownRequest, stream deploy.DeployService_DownServer) error {
    // Nitric provides details such as stack and project name on the request, but you're free to change these up to suit your needs
    s, err := auto.UpsertStackInlineSource(context.TODO(), "<your_stack_name>", "<your_project_name>", nil)
	if err != nil {
		return status.Errorf(codes.Internal, err.Error())
	}

	// destroy the stack
	_, err = s.Destroy(context.TODO(), optdestroy.ProgressStreams(dsMessageWriter))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
}
```
