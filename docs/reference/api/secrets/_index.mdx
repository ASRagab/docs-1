The Nitric Secret service provides a unified programming interface across each major Cloud's secrets management services, including AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager,
and Azure Key Vault. This allows for management and access of secrets such as database passwords, collection URLs and encryption keys, without needing to embed those values in 
configuration files or code. Secrets are generally used to access information in other systems.

## Key concepts

### Secrets, Versions and Values

Secrets are a uniquely named resource containing one or more versions. When you access a secret's value you are accessing a particular version of that secret.

The schema below illustrates this for a secret named `db.password` with two versions:

```
+- Secret [ 'db.password' ]
   |
   +- SecretVersion [ '7F5F86D0-D97F-487F-A5A0-11BAAD00F777' ]
   |  |
   |  +- SecretValue [ 'bleak_dearest_hanged_reigns' ]
   |
   +- SecretVersion [ '0581BBD9-C67F-4E8F-849D-38E52CAEE0EB' ]
      |
      +- SecretValue [ 'crummy_goofed_caddy_radiant' ]
```

> Note: the version numbers are for illustration only. Cloud vendors use different version numbering strategies.

Using versioned secrets allows support for password and key rotation policies.
