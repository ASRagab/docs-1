To process tasks from a queue use a queue reference to `receive` tasks. Since the process is asynchronous, the queue is unaware of whether the task was processed successfully. To ensure failed functions or containers don't result in lost tasks, tasks are not removed from a queue when they're received. Instead, tasks are hidden and receivers are granted a temporary `lease` for each task they receive.

Once the task is complete, the receiver must make a second call to the queue to `complete` the task, which will remove it from the queue. Failing to `complete` a task before the lease expires will result in it being requeued.
