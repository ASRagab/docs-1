Nitric provides a local development experience that helps to emulate cloud environments, including running [Services](./services)/[Functions](./services-functions) as Containers with Dockers and providing simulated or locally executable equivalents for most cloud services, such as [Events & Topics](./events), [Queues](./queues), [Storage](./storage), [KeyValue Stores](./key-value), [Entrypoints](./entrypoints) and [API Gateways](./api-gateways).

The local run functionality is included in the base [Nitric CLI](./nitric-cli), no additional setup steps or plugins are required beyond those in the [Installation Guide](./installation).

## Checking Prerequisites

You can check that any prerequisite software is installed using the `doctor` command. The prerequisite for local run is [Docker](https://docker.com):

```bash
nitric doctor
```

## Run

To build and run your application for local testing use the `run` command with the Nitric CLI, from within your project directory:

```bash
nitric run
```

This will build each of your services into a container and run them along with additional containers for services such as entrypoints and APIs. Additionally, a docker network and volume will be created which allows your services to communicate and share data.

## Stop

While your application is running you'll see a prompt saying **Running, press 'Q' to clean up and exit...** pressing the Q key will initiate the shutdown and cleanup of the temporary resources. Depending on your system this may take a few moments, but should restore your local docker environment to how it was before the code was executed.

The only things persisted between runs are container images which helps speed up the start time on subsequent runs.

## Troubleshooting

If an error occurs during runtime or cleanup, some Docker resources might fail to be cleaned up. The Nitric team is working to improve this, however, in the meantime you can safely delete any of these resources yourself manually.

```bash
# list containers to find any that are lingering
docker ps -a
# delete a container
docker rm [YOUR CONTAINER NAME]

# Check for lingering docker network
docker network list
# If you see a network named after your project, you can delete it
docker network rm [YOUR NETWORK NAME]

# Check for lingering docker volume
docker volume list
# If you see a volume named after your project, you can delete it
docker volume rm [YOUR NETWORK NAME]
```

If you need to troubleshoot a specific service in your project you can use standard Docker commands to interact with the container. One common example is viewing the logs for the container:

```bash
# View logs for a Nitric Service
docker logs [service name from nitric.yaml]
```

## Current Status

Below is a list of the current support status for each Nitric Service, when executed locally using `nitric run`.
