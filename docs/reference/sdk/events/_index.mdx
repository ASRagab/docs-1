title: 'Events Overview'
---

Nitric's events service and API provides an intuitive approach to asynchronous messaging allowing services, functions and more to communicate via topics with event messages. While synchronous request/response communication is quite common, events provide a more reliable mechanism for communication in distributed and serverless systems, with the added benefit that services can be decoupled from each other through a [publish/subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) relationship.

The Nitric events API provides an interface to message-oriented middleware and message brokers such as AWS SNS & Google PubSub to facilitate low-latency, highly available, "at-least once" message delivery.

## Key concepts

- **Topics** are a named resource and target for publishing events. They typically define the _subject_ of the messages being published and subscribed.
- **Events** are a combination of metadata and a payload, produced by publishers and delivered to subscribers. Typically, these take the form of a JSON document with a standard format.
- **Publishers** produce events by sending them to a topic. Publishers are unaware of the topic's subscribers, providing strong decoupling.
- **Subscriptions** define the subscribers of a particular topic. Each subscription defines a subscriber, and the topic they subscribe to.
- **Subscribers** are consumers of events, typically in the form of a request that must handled.
