The Nitric Secret service provides a unified programming interface across common Cloud secrets management services. This allows for management and access of secrets such as database passwords,
collection URLs and encryption keys, without embedding those values in configuration files or code. Secrets are generally used to access information in other systems.

Currently supported services include AWS Secrets Manager and GCP Secret Manager.

> Support for Azure Key Vault is also on the roadmap

## Key concepts

### Secrets, Versions and Values

Secrets are a uniquely named resource containing one or more versions. When you access a secret's value you are accessing a particular version of that secret.

The schema below illustrates this for a secret named `db.password` with two versions:

```
+- Secret [ 'db.password' ]
   |
   +- SecretVersion [ '7F5F86D0-D97F-487F-A5A0-11BAAD00F777' ]
   |  |
   |  +- SecretValue [ 'bleak_dearest_hanged_reigns' ]
   |
   +- SecretVersion [ '0581BBD9-C67F-4E8F-849D-38E52CAEE0EB' ]
      |
      +- SecretValue [ 'crummy_goofed_caddy_radiant' ]
```

> Note: the version numbers are for illustration only. Cloud vendors use different version numbering strategies.

Using versioned secrets allows support for password and key rotation policies.

### References and Secret Access

When using the one of the Nitric SDKs, the Secret and SecretVersion objects are light-weight references.

To access the value of a secret (data) you use the SecretVersion `access()` method which will make a server call returning a SecretValue object.

To get the latest version of a secret you use the `latest()` method on the Secret object.
