title: Defining Queues
---

The first step before tasks can be sent or received is to define a queue. Queues are a resource defined in a Nitric Stack file, such as `nitric.yaml`. At the root level of the stack definition, there can be a `queues` key, which contains and array of queues.

The provider specific implementations for a queue are decided based on the best practices for implementing queue-like behavior in each environment.

> For specific detail on how queues are implemented for each provider see here.

```yaml
queues:
	# Create queues with default options
	my-queue: {}
	my-other-queue: {}
```

<!-- ### Syntax
To define a queue in your Nitric Stack, use the following syntax:

**_YAML_**

```yaml
- name: String
```

**_Properties_**

`name`

Defines the unique name of the queue, used in all future interactions with the queue via Nitric tooling and SDKs.

> **Note:** must contain only letters, numbers and dashes.

_Required:_ Yes

_Type:_ String -->

## Setup Producers

> Coming Soon: Capability to limit queue push capability to a subset of services
