A Nitric queue is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. A queue represents a category or tasks that are asynchronously processed by a service.

## Properties

> Queues do not have properties at present and are represented only by their name at this time. This is subject to change as requirements around queue configuration emerge.

## Example

```yaml
name: example-stack

queues:
  example-queue: {}
```

See the [Queue API](../api/queues) reference for examples of interacting with defined queues.
