A Nitric function is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. Nitric functions are a type of [Service](../../intro/services) that offers a portable way to develop function-as-a-service (FaaS) applications, which can then be deployed to
popular Serverless offerings like AWS Lamda, Google CloudRun and Azure AppService.

## Adding a new Function

Start by fetching the latest function templates:

```bash
nitric templates:repos:add function
```

Then add the function:

```bash
nitric make:service
```

This will populate the `nitric.yaml` file with an entry for the function

## Properties

`name` the name of the Nitric function. Must be unique to the stack file as it is used as the reference to the function for entrypoints and apis.

`handler` the path to the function handler, relative to the root of the project.

```yaml
name: example-stack

functions:
  example-function:
    handler: functions/get.ts
  other-example-function:
    handler: functions/set.ts
```

See [Function Concepts]() for more information on interacting with functions.
