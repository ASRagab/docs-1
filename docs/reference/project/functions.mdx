A Nitric function is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. Nitric functions are a type of [Service](../../intro/services) that offers a portable way to develop function-as-a-service (FaaS) applications, which can then be deployed to
popular Serverless offerings like AWS Lamda, Google CloudRun and Azure AppService.
