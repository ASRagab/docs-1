A Nitric function is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. Nitric functions are a type of [Service](../../intro/services) that offers a portable way to develop function-as-a-service (FaaS) applications, which can then be deployed to
popular Serverless offerings like AWS Lamda, Google CloudRun and Azure AppService.

## Properties

`name` the name of the Nitric function. Must be unique to the stack file as it is used as the reference to the function for entrypoints and apis.

`handler` the path to the function handler, relative to the root of the project.

There are optional properties for when triggering a function with a topic.

`triggers` the [topic(s)](./topics.mdx) that this function subscribes to.

```yaml
name: example-stack

functions:
  example-function:
    handler: functions/get.ts
  subscribed-example-function:
    handler: functions/set.ts
    triggers:
      topics:
        - example-topic

topics:
  example-topic: {}
```
