A Nitric bucket is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. A bucket represents a container for the storage of blobs/binary data.

## Properties

> Buckets do not have properties at present and are represented only by their name at this time. This is subject to change over time as requirements around bucket configuration emerge

## Example

```yaml
name: example-stack

buckets:
  example-bucket: {}
```

See the [Storage API](../api/storage) reference for examples of interacting with defined buckets.
