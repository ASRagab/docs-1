A Nitric topic is described by its definition in a `nitric.yaml` file. A topic is category/feed of events that can be published/subscribed to by applications to facilitate reactive messaging in a stack.

## Properties

> Topics do not have properties at present and are represented only by their name at this time. This is subject to change as requirements around topic configuration emerge.

## Example

```yaml
name: example-stack

topics:
  example-example-topic: {}
```

See the [Events API](../api/events) reference for examples of interacting with defined topics.
