Nitric sites allow static site content to be automatically uploaded to a bucket as part of your stack deployment.

Sites can be easily wired up to the rest of your stack by using [entrypoints](./entrypoints.mdx), allowing you to easily access other services directly from your site under a single origin.

> Support for static sites is currently limited to a few providers, to see if a provider is compatible see the table [here](./nitric-apis.mdx)

## Example Site

```yaml
name: example-stack
sites:
	example-site:
		path: example-site
		assetPath: ./static
		buildScripts:
			- npm build
```

## Properties

| **Property** | **Value** | **Description**                                                         |
| ------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| path         | string    | path of the static site project relative to root of your nitric project |
| assetPath    | string    | location of static site assets once site is built relative to path      |
| buildScripts | string[]  | Scripts to run in order to build static site assets                     |

## Connecting your site to your stack

To host and wire up your site to the rest of your stack you will need to use [entrypoints](./entrypoints.mdx)

```yaml
name: example-site

services:
	example-service:
		path: example-service
		runtime: function/nodejs12

sites:
	example-site:
		path: example-site
		assetPath: ./static
		buildScripts:
			- npm build

entrypoints:
	main:
		paths:
			/:
				type: site
				target: example-site
			/example/:
				type: service
				target: example-service
```

In the above example your site would now be able to call the example-service, by simply making a request to `/example/`, as these two resources will be served under a single origin together.
