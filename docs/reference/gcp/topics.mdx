## GCP Resources

The following resources are created when deploying Topics to Azure:

- Pubsub Topic
- Pubsub Subscription (push)
- Cloud Run (subscribers)

## Deployment

During deployment Nitric's CLI builds your Topics will be built as follows:

- Cloud run applications that subscribe will have a push subscription deployed for them
