Most applications have a need to persist and retrieve state. Nitric strives to make this process as easy as possible, using a key/value API
Key/Value collections provide a highly efficient way to store and retrieve application state based on unique keys. Nitric provides an interface to create, retrieve and query collections of key/value records, as well as mechanisms to define and deploy these collections to supported infrastructure.

## Create Collections

Collections are a resource defined in a Nitric stack definition (`nitric.yaml`). At the root level of the stack file, add a `collectsions` key, which contains an array of collections.

```yaml
collections:
  orders:
    attributes:
      pk: string
      price: string
      number: string
      value: string
    indexes:
      unique: pk
```

## Defining Indexes

### Composite Indexes

Defining Composite Keys

```yaml
collections:
  application:
    attributes:
      pk: string
      sk: string
      created: string
      value: string
    indexes:
      composite: [ pk, sk ]
```
