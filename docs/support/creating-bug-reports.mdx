## Overview

You can help us improve Nitric by creating **bug reports**. When creating a bug report, it's important that you include as much information as possible about your issue. That way, it's easier to reproduce and fix the issue.

> You can also create **feature requests** or ask a **question** via the issue templates on GitHub.

## Where do I open the bug report?

The Nitric framework has many different repositories in the <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech" target="_blank">nitrictech</a> organization on GitHub. If you have an issue with any component, you can open a new issue in the respective repo.

If you're unsure where to open the GitHub issue, you can use our main <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric" target="_blank">nitrictech/nitric</a> repo. The Nitric team frequently monitors and triages new issues within this main repo and will move the issue to another repo if required.

## Share reproduction of bug

To best help us understand and tackle the issue effectively, provide a **standalone GitHub repository** in your report that can reproduce the issue.

For information on how to create minimal, reproducible examples you can view this informative <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example" target="_blank">Stackoverflow guide</a>.

## Best practices for writing the bug report

If you don't have time to create a standalone repository, please include as much information as you can can about the issue, use the <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=%27Create%20bug%20report%27" target="_blank">Bug report template</a> from our main repo to help guide you.

### Include .nitric log files

Log files can be found in your stack directory under the `.nitric` folder.
Including Log files will provide a ton of useful information logged during local run and cloud deployments.

### Include bug description and reproduction

When describing the bug, it's help to produce the following information:

- A clear and concise description of what the bug is
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen
- Screenshots (if applicable)

### Include environment and setup information

Any information about your environment and setup will be important to help reproduce the bug. Please include the following:

- Which version of the **Nitric CLI** you are using (run `nitric -v` to see your version)
  - Running this command also provides your **Operating System** and **Node.js** version
- Any nitric dependencies and their version such as SDKs or Middleware
- Which cloud providers you are deploying to
- Your `nitric.yaml` stack file

### Example Report

**Describe the bug:**

Returning a JSON response in my list handler doesn't work, it returns nothing and times out.

**Steps to reproduce:**

I updated the nitric node stack list handler to set the response body to a JSON string.

```typescript
import { faas } from '@nitric/sdk';

faas
  .http(async (ctx) => {
    ctx.res.body = JSON.stringify({ message: 'My Successful Response' });

    return ctx;
  })
  .start();
```

Then I run `nitric run` to run nitric locally.

I then use curl to test the handler's endpoint and don't get any response from the server:

```bash
curl http://localhost:49152/examples
```

**What I expected:**

I expected to see the JSON response printed to my terminal in a readable format or at least an error explaining what I did wrong.

**Environment and setup information:**

- Nitric CLI version: `@nitric/cli/0.1.0 win32-x64 node-v16.4.0`
- Dependencies used: @nitric/sdk@1.0.0
- Cloud providers: AWS, Google Cloud
- Nitric Stack file:
