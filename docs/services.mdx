Nitric services are a provider independent compute offering, that allows you to write code in
a variety of popular languages and frameworks without the need to worry about servers, scaling,
integrating with event/topic services, or managing the underlying runtime software.

## How it works

1. Create a new service using the Nitric CLI in a language/runtime of your choice
2. Write your service, which handles requests and returns responses
3. Run your application locally, Nitric will package each of your services into a container and wire them together, so they can access resources such as topics, queues, storage, etc.
4. Use the build and deploy commands to build your services for a provider and deploy to that provider for testing, staging or production release.

## Create Services

Services are defined in a project's `nitric.yaml` file and code and other files are stored in a subdirectory of the project. The easiest way to generate a new service is with the `add:service` CLI command.

This command will guide you through choosing the runtime/language and name for your service, then scaffold it and update the `nitric.yaml` file.

```bash
nitric add:service
```

## Service Anatomy

Nitric services are packaged into Docker containers, along with the Nitric membrane.
This insulates your services from cloud and infrastructure concerns.

## Running Services

The Nitric CLI provides the [`run` command](./nitric-cli) specifically for running applications on a local machine. This command builds your application into containers, sets up a simulated provider environment and executes the application.

From the root of your project run the following command:

```bash
nitric run
```

## Triggering Services

Services can run in response to various triggers including Requests, [Events](./events) and [Schedules](./schedules).

These are wired up using the `triggers` property of the service in the nitric.yaml definition.

Example triggering a service using a Nitric Topic:

```yaml
name: my-nitric-app

services:
	example:
		path: example
		runtime: function/golang15
		triggers:
			topics:
				- exampleTopic

topics:
	exampleTopic: {}
```
