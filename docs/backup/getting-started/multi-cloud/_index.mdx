title: Get Started with Nitric
---

Nitric's framework can create, deploy and manage your applications on **multiple** cloud providers using our [SDKs](/docs/intro/concepts/sdks).
The [Nitric CLI](/docs/reference/cli) helps you develop, deploy and manage your application within minutes.

To showcase how Nitric deploys your Stack to the Cloud, this tutorial takes you through the following steps to easily create and deploy a new document API Service:

1. Install Nitric and create a new Nitric stack in a familiar language of your choice.
2. Running your new stack locally for development.
3. Deploying the API Service to the Cloud Provider of your choice.
4. Modifying the API Service by creating a new `delete` function.
5. Deploying the changes to the Cloud Provider of your choice.
6. Cleaning up your deployment by pulling down all the resources you've provisioned.
