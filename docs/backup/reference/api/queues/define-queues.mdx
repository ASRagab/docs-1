title: Defining Queues
---

The first step before tasks can be sent or received is to define a queue. Queues are a resource defined in a Nitric Stack file, such as `nitric.yaml`. At the root level of the stack definition, there can be a `queues` key, which contains an array of queues.

```yaml
queues:
	# Create queues with default options
	my-queue: {}
	my-other-queue: {}
```

<!-- ### Syntax
To define a queue in your Nitric Stack, use the following syntax:

**_YAML_**

```yaml
- name: String
```

**_Properties_**

`name`

Defines the unique name of the queue, used in all future interactions with the queue via Nitric tooling and SDKs.

> **Note:** must contain only letters, numbers and dashes.

_Required:_ Yes

_Type:_ String -->

During our preview release, no additional configuration is needed or available to create queues. All functions and containers in your Nitric project will be configured with appropriate permissions allowing them to send and received from all available topics. Future configuration will be introduced to define the list of permitted senders and receivers (enabling least-privilege security by default), as well as configure more advanced queue features.
