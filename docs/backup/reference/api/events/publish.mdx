title: Publish Events
---

Once a topic has been defined, functions and other code can publish to it using one of the Nitric SDKs. At minimum, a publish request requires the name of the topic to publish to and the payload of the event to publish. An event's payload is typically a JSON string, however, the Nitric SDKs will often accept a 'plain old object' or map/dictionary value to simplify the code needed to publish events.

	{

	{

		value: "python"

		label: "Java",
		value: "java"
	},
	{
		label: "Go",
		value: "go"
	}

### Event IDs

It's essential that every event can be uniquely identified so that subscribers can be idempotent. To assist with this, Nitric Events include an ID property which should contain the unique ID for that event. By default, the Nitric Membrane will automatically generate this ID as a v4 UUID for every published event if it doesn't already contain an ID. Custom ID creation can be implemented by your code by providing this ID during publishing:

<CodeExamples
	languages={[
	{
		label: "Node",
		value: "node"
	},
	{
		label: "Python",
		value: "python"
	},
	{
		label: "Java",
		value: "java"
	},
	{
		label: "Go",
		value: "go"
	}
	]}

#### Atomicity of Events

When implementing design patterns that allow for atomic state changes and event publishing, such as [Transactional Outbox](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transactional-outbox.html), it's critical that any attempt to 'republish' an event due to a failure reuses the same event ID as any previous attempts. This ensures duplicate event deliveries won't contain mismatching IDs in the case that a previous attempt silently succeeded, while appearing to fail. In these cases we recommend generating your own event ID and storing it in the outbox record. Ensuring duplicate events will contain matching keys is essential to allow for [idempotent subscribers]().

> Event IDs are automatically generated by the Nitric Membrane as v4 UUIDs. However, an ID should be provided when [publishing events](#event-ids) via the SDK when implementing atomic events/idempotent subscribers.
