title: 'Storage Overview'
---

Nitric provides resources and SDK clients for secure object storage.
This is typically used to read and write items such as static website content, images, files and other binary data.

### Key concepts

- **Buckets** are named data stores which contain stored objects.
- **Accessors** is the name used for readers and writers of object data from buckets.

## Defining Buckets

Buckets are a top-level resource defined in the stack definition. Before reading or writing objects you can add a bucket to the `nitric.yaml` or equivalent:

```yaml
buckets:
	my-bucket: {}
```

## Setup Accessors

> Coming Soon: The capability to lock down readers/writers of buckets within a stack
