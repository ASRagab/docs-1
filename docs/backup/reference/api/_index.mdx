The Nitric SDK provides the core functions that you will use to write services in your applications, common to all cloud providers.
The SDK works with the Nitric CLI to define the resources and make them available, such as defining document collections or storage buckets. The SDK is available as a library in your chosen language, you can choose your language runtime in any of the reference pages.

> For a conceptual overview of how to use the apis available in these libraries, please see the [Concepts section](/docs/intro/concepts/projects).
