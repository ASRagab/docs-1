By default, Nitric applications are developed in a standard "project" structure. You're welcome to change this structure as needed for your situation, but it provides a straight-forward starting point for most applications. The only restrictions you might find are in the sub-directory structures for resources like [`services`](./services) which, depending on the template used, may rely on their structure to build/compile successfully.

## The Project Directory

Your application will typically be stored in a single directory named after your project (although it can have any name you like). This root directory will contain a Virtual Stack Definition named `nitric.yaml` by default, as well all other project files or sub-directories.

### The Virtual Stack Definition

Named `nitric.yaml` by default, this file defines your application and its resources. Since resources such as topics, queues, buckets, etc. are as much a part of modern applications as the code is, this file also defines all of these resources and their interactions. The benefit of this model is that the "intention" behind these interactions is clearly described, allowing for consistent implementations between providers.

### Resource Sub-directories

Application resources defined in the stack definition which have associated files, such as [`services`](./services) & [`sites`](./sites), are typically stored in a subdirectory of the project named after that resource. For example, an application with a single function and a static site might look like this:

```txt
my-project/
|
+--nitric.yaml
+--function/
+--website/
```

The internal structure of these sub-directories is dependent on the resources they contain, typical structures are described in the documentation for each resource.
