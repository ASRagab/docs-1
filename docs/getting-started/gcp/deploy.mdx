When you're ready to deploy your application to Google Cloud, you can use the GCP CLI Plugin to automate the deployment process. Use the `deploy` command from the root of your project to start an interactive deployment process:

```bash
nitric deploy:gcp
```

To update an existing deployment, simply re-run the command.
