> **Partial Support:** Nitric currently supports DigitalOcean for [Services](./services) and [Entrypoints](./entrypoints) only.

Nitric applications are supported on DigitalOcean, however many features are currently unavailable or under development. You can automatically deploy an existing application to DigitalOcean using the [Nitric CLI](./nitric-cli), with the DigitalOcean plugin.

## Installing the CLI plugin

To install the official Nitric DigitalOcean Plugin, running the following command:

```bash
nitric plugins:install @nitric/plugin-do
```

This will download and install DigitalOcean specific commands for the cli.

## Checking Prerequisites

Next, you can check that any prerequisite software is also installed by using the doctor sub-command for DigitalOcean:

```bash
nitric doctor:do
```

## Setup Credentials

The Nitric DigitalOcean CLI Plugin requires a Personal Access Token to authenticate with the DigitalOcean API. This can be provided via an environment variable, like so:

```bash
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your own token value. You can create a Personal Access Token by logging into the <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">DigitalOcean Console</a> and navigating to `API (under 'ACCOUNT')` > `Tokens/Keys` > `Personal Access Tokens` > `Generate New Token`.
