When you're ready to deploy your application to AWS, you can use the AWS CLI Plugin to automate the deployment process. Use the `deploy` command from the root of your project to start an interactive deployment process, with prompts for Account ID & Region:

```bash
nitric deploy:aws
```

To update an existing deployment, simply re-run the command.
