Nitric applications are supported on Amazon Web Services (AWS) by default. You can automatically deploy an existing application to AWS using the [Nitric CLI](/docs/reference/cli), with the AWS plugin.

### Install AWS Plugin

To install the official Nitric AWS Plugin, running the following command:

```bash
nitric plugins:install @nitric/plugin-aws
```

This will download and install AWS specific commands for the cli.

## Check Prerequisites

Next, you can check that any prerequisite software is also installed by using the doctor sub-command for AWS:

```bash
nitric doctor:aws
```

## Configure Credentials

The Nitric AWS CLI Plugin is able to use standard AWS credential settings to authenticate with AWS. If you've set up local credentials for the AWS CLI or an SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting up your credentials for the first time, there are several available methods. We recommend the standard AWS credentials file, which can be setup like so:

- Create a new credentials files at one of these locations:
  - `~/.aws/credentials` on Linux, macOS, or Unix
  - `C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials` on Windows

The file should contain the following:

```toml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key_id
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_access_key
```

Replace `your_access_key_id` and `your_secret_access_key` with your own values. You can create an Access Key by logging into the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/" target="_blank">AWS console</a> and navigating to `Username Menu` > `My Security Credentials` > `Access keys` > `Create New Access Key`.

> See AWS documentation for full details on credentials and configuration. E.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html
