Now that youâ€™ve seen how to deploy changes to our API service, letâ€™s clean up and pull down the resources that are part of your stack.

To pull down all stack resources, run the following from the root of your project:

<CodeExamples 
	languages={[
	{
		icon: <img src="/img/logos/aws.png" noMargin priority width={70} height={50} />,
		value: "aws",
	}, {
		icon: <img src="/img/logos/gcp.svg" noMargin priority width={100} height={70} />,
		value: "gcp"
	}, {
		icon: <img src="/img/logos/azure.png" noMargin priority width={100} height={70} />,
		value: "azure"
	}, {
		icon: <img src="/img/logos/digital-ocean.png" noMargin priority width={100} height={70} />,
		value: "do"
	}
	]}
	defaultLang="aws"
>
<CodeExample lang={"aws"}>

```bash
nitric down:aws
```

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"gcp"}>

```bash
nitric down:gcp
```

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"azure"}>

<Box pt={4}>

> ðŸš§ Support for Microsoft Azure is currently in development and will be available soon.

</Box>

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"do"}>

```bash
nitric down:do
```

</CodeExample>
</CodeExamples>

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve successfully deployed an API using Nitric. By completing this guide you have successfully:

- Created a new Nitric Stack.
- Ran your Stack for local development.
- Added a new function to your API.
- Deployed your API to the cloud of your choice.
- Pulled down the resources you've deployed.

The fun doesnt end here, on the next page we have a bunch of examples and guides that you can use as a foundation for your own projects.
Also you can visit our [samples](/docs/samples) page, where you can search for samples via language, category and skill level.
