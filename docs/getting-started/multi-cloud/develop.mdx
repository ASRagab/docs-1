Nitric provides a local development experience that helps to emulate cloud environments, including running [Services](/docs/intro/concepts/services)/[Functions](/docs/intro/concepts/functions) as Containers with Docker and providing simulated or locally executable equivalents for most cloud services, such as [Events & Topics](/docs/reference/services/events), [Queues](/docs/reference/services/queues), [Storage](/docs/reference/services/storage), [KeyValue Stores](/docs/reference/services/key-value), [Entrypoints](/docs/reference/services/entrypoints) and [API Gateways](/docs/reference/services/api-gateways).

The local run functionality is included in the base [Nitric CLI](/docs/reference/cli), no additional setup steps or plugins are required beyond those in the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Checking Prerequisites

You can check that any prerequisite software is installed using the doctor command. The prerequisite for local run is <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank">Docker</a>:

```bash
nitric doctor
```

If you have all the prerequisite software installed, you will see the following message:

```bash
 Doctor summary:
 ───────────────
 ☁️ pulumi
 🐳 docker

Good to go 👍 Enjoy using Nitric 🎉
```

## Run the stack!

Let's start developing, use the `run` command to begin:

```bash
nitric run
```

```bash
✔ Building Services
✔ Creating docker network
✔ Running Functions & Containers
✔ Starting API Gateways
✔ Starting Entrypoints
 Function Port
 ──────── ─────
 create   54002
 list     54003
 read     54004
 Api     Port
 ─────── ─────
 examples 49152
Running, press 'Q' to clean up and exit... /
```

Once running, use your browser to navigate to localhost on the port provided for the examples API, e.g. <a href="http://localhost:49152/examples" target="_blank">http://localhost:49152/examples</a>. You should receive a success response from the list function.

> The first time you run a stack it will take a moment longer to start while Docker image layers are downloaded and cached on your machine.

Once it starts, the application will receive requests via the API port. You can use cURL, Postman or any other HTTP client to test the API.

## Test out the API

You can use cURL, Postman or any other HTTP client to test the API.

Replace the `49152` PORT in the snippets below to yours if it is different.

Create an example:

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"first example", "description":"Take me to the moon 🚀"}' http://localhost:49152/examples
```

Retrieve an example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:49152/examples/YOUR_EXAMPLE_ID
```

List all examples:

```bash
curl http://localhost:49152/examples
```

Next, you’ll deploy your stack to the cloud provider of your choice.
