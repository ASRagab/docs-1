## Get the Nitric CLI

The Nitric CLI assists with most tasks you'll perform while developing with Nitric. You can use the CLI to create new projects and services, run a project locally, build a project for one or more providers and deploy your projects to the cloud.

### Step 1: Install CLI

<CodeExamples 
	languages={[
	{
		label: "macOS",
		value: "mac"
	}, {
		label: "Windows",
		value: "win"
	}, {
		label: "Linux",
		value: "linux"
	}
	]}
	defaultLang="mac"
>
<CodeExample lang={"win"}>

#### NPM

You can install Nitric using the [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm install -g @nitric/cli
```

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"mac"}>

```

</CodeExample>
</CodeExamples>

#### Manual installation

Alternatively, if you prefer not to use one of the automated methods above, you can download the Nitric CLI binary.

1. Download the appropriate binary for your system from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/nitrictech/cli/releases/latest).
2. Add the binary to your system's PATH or move it to a folder already included in your PATH.

### Step 2: Verify the installation

```bash
nitric
```

The output should be something like:

```bash
CLI tool for nitric applications

VERSION
  @nitric/cli/0.0.82 win32-x64 node-v16.4.0

USAGE
  $ nitric [COMMAND]

TOPICS
  deploy     Plugin commands to deploy on supported providers. E.g. `$ nitric deploy:aws`
  doctor     check environment for config and prerequisite software
  down       Plugin commands to tear down deployments on supported providers. E.g. `$ nitric down:aws`
  make       Commands to make new projects and assets.
  plugins    list installed plugins
  templates  Commands for template management
  token      convenience method to generate an access token for GCP

COMMANDS
  build    build a project
  doctor   check environment for config and prerequisite software
  help     display help for nitric
  plugins  list installed plugins
  run      builds and runs a project locally for testing
```

### Step 3: Verify dependencies

The Nitric CLI depends on some other software for activities like building container images and deployment. You can verify that dependent software is installed using the `doctor` command. You'll be prompted to install any missing software.

```bash
nitric doctor
```

The output should be:

```bash
Doctor summary:
‚òÅÔ∏è pulumi
üê≥ docker
üöÄ setup a nitric repository

Good to go üëç Enjoy using Nitric üéâ
```

### Step 4: Next Steps

At this point you have everything setup and ready to build applications, then run and test them locally. You can read more about the [Nitric CLI](./nitric-cli), try out a [Tutorial](./quick-start) or if you're ready to deploy an application to a cloud environment, you can install the relevant [CLI Plugin](./nitric-cli#plugins) for [AWS](./provider-aws), [Google Cloud](./provider-gcp), [DigitalOcean](./provider-digitalocean) or [Microsoft Azure](./provider-azure).
