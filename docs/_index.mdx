Welcome to the Nitric documentation! Where you can learn what Nitric is, how to get started using it, and reference guides and samples for its feature on all supported cloud providers.

## What is Nitric?

Nitric is an <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric" target="_blank">Open-Source</a> Cloud Application Framework, focused on rapid development of portable Cloud and Serverless applications, capable of running on many popular cloud environments from a single codebase. Applications built with Nitric can be developed in any language, with SDKs and Templates for TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go and Java.

## Why Nitric?

There are already great frameworks and tools to independently solve the problems of cloud development or portability. However, portable options often prohibit use of managed cloud services, since they're typically proprietary and lead to lock-in. Alternatively, development frameworks assist with rapidly building applications for the cloud, including the use of managed services, but the result is an application that will only run on a single cloud platform.

Nitric is unique in its ability to allow development of applications, which use the fully-managed services of each cloud provider, while maintaining application portability between those providers, and their equivalent services, from a single codebase.

Instead of integrating directly with cloud provider APIs for services such as compute, events, queues, documents, storage and caching, Nitric provides a single set of APIs for every supported service. These APIs are fulfilled by a lightweight translation layer, connecting to those services on your behalf. Translation is implemented via plugins, enabling complete flexibility without changing application code.

Additionally, Nitric provides a common Request/Response interface, ensuring requests are consistent regardless of the cloud provider or the source. This includes both HTTP and asynchronous event based requests.

### Ready for Scale

Nitric encourages and assists in the use of stateless and asynchronous techniques to achieve massive scalability. Built around Serverless technologies, applications on Nitric scale horizontally by default, including scaling to zero when volume drops off (on supported clouds), meaning you pay only for what you need and scale to meet peek demands.

### Open Source

When it comes to application portability, we believe in opening up cloud technologies and reducing technology lock-in. We also believe the opinions and contributions of the community leads to better software and faster innovation. That's why Nitric is free and open source.
