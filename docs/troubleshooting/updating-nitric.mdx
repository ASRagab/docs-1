## Updating Nitric

If you're ready to upgrade your projects to a newer version of Nitric

- Start by removing any versions of the membrane which are currently residing on Docker `docker system prune -a`
- Update your local store of templates `nitric templates:repos:add`
- In your project(s) remove the templates folder which resides in .nitric 
- Create a new project for each of the templates which you are using `nitric make:service` this will update the .nitric folder with the appropriate templates.
- Fix dependencies which have been broken in your existing projects. 

    - E.g. in a go project, you'll need to delete the .sum file and update the .mod file to point to the correct version.
