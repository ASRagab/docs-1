## Updating Nitric

If you're ready to upgrade your projects to a newer version of Nitric

- Start by refreshing any versions of the membrane which are currently residing on Docker:
  - Run `docker image rm nitricimages/membrane-local`
  - Checkout the latest version of the membrane
  - Run `make dev-docker` (or other target e.g. `make aws-docker`. Please refer to the [membrane readme](https://github.com/nitrictech/membrane/blob/main/README.md) for more details 
  - Update the local membrane with `docker pull nitricimages/membrane-local`
  - Note - If you encounter issues with the previous step(s) then prune docker with the following command `docker system prune -a`
- Update your local store of templates `nitric templates:repos:add`
- In your project(s) remove the templates folder which resides in .nitric
- Create a new project for each of the templates which you are using `nitric make:service` this will update the .nitric folder with the appropriate templates.
- Fix dependencies which have been broken in your existing projects.

  - E.g. in a go project, you'll need to delete the .sum file and update the .mod file to point to the correct version.

  `require github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk v0.3.0` --> `require github.com/nitrictech/go-sdk v0.4.0`
