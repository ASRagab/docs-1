When evaluating Nitric against a fully in-house custom build, it is important to consider the total cost of ownership of these options. Also when not choosing Nitric there are likely to be serious down stream implications for the business which need to be understood.

Nitric provides a comprehensive set of features for the rapid development of multi-cloud solutions including:

- automated multi-cloud deployment and CLI
- declarative stack definitions
- Membrane multi-cloud application gateway/adaptor
- multi-cloud service APIs
- FaaS micro-framework
- supports multiple development languages
- project templates
- comprehensive documentation

For most organizations developing these capabilities in house is a non-starter because:

- prohibitive time and cost of this development
- difficulty of attracting the require development staff
- ongoing maintenance and support costs
- focus on undifferentiated heavy lifting rather than the Business objectives

Making the choice for Custom Build over Nitric prematurely reduces Optionality for the business, this may include:

- only supporting one Cloud vendor, limiting future business sales options and reduces cloud pricing control
- supporting only one language, which can limit future business sales options, it also limits available dev talent and the best language choice for the domain
