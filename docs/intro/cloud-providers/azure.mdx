Nitric applications are supported on Microsoft Azure by default. You can automatically deploy an existing application to Azure using the [Nitric CLI](/docs/reference/cli), with the Azure plugin.

## Installing the CLI plugin

To install the official Nitric AWS Plugin, running the following command:

```bash
nitric-dev plugins:install @nitric/plugin-azure
```

This will download and install Azure specific commands for the cli.

## Checking Prerequisites

Next, you can check that any prerequisite software is also installed by using the doctor sub-command for Azure:

```bash
nitric doctor:azure
```

##### Install Azure CLI

Also ensure you have installed Azure CLI. For alternative Linux install options please see [Install the Azure CLI on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt).

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

Verify the Azure CLI install by:

```bash
az -v
```

## Setup Credentials

The Nitric Azure CLI Plugin uses the standard Azure credentials to authenticate with Azure. If you've set up local credentials for the Azure CLI or an SDK previously, these settings should work without modification.

If you're setting up your credentials for the first time, simply run the following command and finish the login via the browser:

```bash
az login
```

## Deploy

When you're ready to deploy your application to Azure, you can use the Azure CLI Plugin to automate the deployment process.

Use the `deploy` command from the root of your project to start an interactive deployment process, with prompts for Azure region, org. name and admin email:

```bash
$ nitric deploy:azure
```

To update an existing deployment, simply re-run the command.

## Undeploy

To pull down a previously deployed application from Azure, run the down command from the root of your project.

```bash
nitric down:azure
```
