## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started in Python is by using a stack template. Within an empty directory in which you'd like to create a new stack:

```bash
nitric make:stack
```

Then choose:

```bash
? Stack template (Use arrow keys)
  official/TypeScript Stack
❯ official/Python Stack
  official/Java Stack
  official/Go Stack
```

This will create a `nitric.yaml` [stack](/docs/intro/concepts/stack) file, a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies, a `common` directory containing common shared code, and a `functions` directory, containing your functions code.

## Nitric Programming Model

The Nitric programming model consists of all the concepts you will use when creating stacks using the Nitric platform.
All concepts such as [Projects](/docs/intro/concepts/projects), [Stacks](/docs/intro/concepts/stacks), [Compute](/docs/intro/concepts/compute) and [Unified APIs](/docs/intro/concepts/nitric-apis) are described under the concepts section.

The <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech/python-sdk" target="_blank">Nitric SDK</a> is available to Python developers as a <a href="https://pypi.org/project/nitric/" target="_blank">pypi package</a>.
