## Getting Started

The fastest way to get started in JavaScript (we recommend TypeScript) is by using a stack template. Within an empty directory in which you'd like to create a new stack:

```bash
nitric make:stack
```

Then choose:

```bash
? Stack template (Use arrow keys)
❯ official/TypeScript Stack
  official/Python Stack
  official/Java Stack
  official/Go Stack
```

This will create a `nitric.yaml` [stack](/docs/intro/concepts/stack) file, a `package.json` file for dependencies, a `common` directory containing common shared code, and a `functions` directory, containing your functions code.

## Nitric Programming Model

The Nitric programming model consists of all the concepts you will use when creating stacks using the Nitric platform.
All concepts such as [Projects](/docs/intro/concepts/projects), [Stacks](/docs/intro/concepts/stack), [Services](/docs/intro/concepts/services) and [Functions](/docs/intro/concepts/functions) are described under the concepts section.

The <a href="https://github.com/nitrictech/node-sdk" target="_blank">Nitric SDK</a> is available to Node.js developers as a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nitric/sdk" target="_blank">NPM package</a>. To learn more, refer to the [SDK Reference Guide](/docs/reference/sdks).
