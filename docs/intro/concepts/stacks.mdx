A Stack is a collection of resources defined using a stack file, named `nitric.yaml` by default. Stacks typically define some code functions and cloud resources. Some stacks are infrastructure only, deploying shared resources and act as a dependency to other stacks. A REST API would typically be defined in a Stack.

## Create a Stack

To create a new stack, use the `nitric make:stack` command. This will guide you through creating a new Stack in the language of your choice. 

Stack names may only contain lowercase letters and dashes only e.g. orders-service.

```bash
nitric make:stack
```

Multiple project types are possible with the Nitric, such a single and multi stack projects. To view them, please see the [Project Types](/docs/intro/concepts/projects#project-types) section.

## Deploy a stack

To deploy a stack, run `nitric deploy:<your-provider>` within the stack's directory. View the [deployment section](/docs/getting-started/multi-cloud/deploy) of our Multi-Cloud tutorial to learn more.

## Undeploy a Stack

To remove all resources associated with the stack from the cloud. use the `nitric down:<your-provider>` command within the stack's direction.
