Nitric provides portable Compute with Functions and custom Docker container builds allowing you to write code in a variety of popular languages and frameworks without needing to worry about servers, scaling, integrating with event/topic services, or managing the underlying runtime software.

Nitric automatically builds your code into OCI compliant Docker containers and can run them locally for development or deploy them to leading Container-as-a-Service offerings such as AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Run and DigitalOcean App Platform.

## How it works

1. Create a new stack using the Nitric CLI based on a [Stack](./stack)
2. Write your function code, which handles events or HTTP requests and returns responses
3. Run your application locally, Nitric will package each of your functions into a container and wire them together, so they can access resources such as topics, queues, storage, etc.
4. Use the build and deploy commands to build your functtions for a provider and deploy to that provider for testing, staging or production release.

## Compute Architecture

Nitric Functions and custom Docker builds are packaged into Docker containers, along with the [Nitric Membrane](./nitric-membrane). This insulates your code from cloud and infrastructure concerns.
