Nitric achieves portability by decoupling applications from proprietary fully-managed cloud services, using common abstractions and adapter APIs provided by the Nitric Membrane. This is in contrast to typical portability solutions, which simply lock teams out of using those services altogether. Avoiding managed services can assist with portability, but it comes at the cost of losing many of the benefits that make cloud providers appealing in the first place.

Applications built using Nitric have access to a variety of 'Virtual Cloud Services'. These services are provided by the Nitric Membrane as APIs, which interact with managed-cloud services on behalf of your applications to achieve API consistency. We've tried to use intuitive naming for these APIs, avoiding proprietary product names, to ensure the services are easier to learn and "do exactly what they say on the tin".

Below is a list of the services currently offered by Nitric, and the underlying product/technology used for each on supported providers:

## What about different services on the same cloud?

The initial goal for Nitric is freedom of choice in terms of which cloud provider(s) applications run on without modification. The next stages will also include additional flexibility within those clouds. Want to use ECS Fargate or App Runner on AWS instead of Lambda? Need to use MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud for Documents? [Get in touch](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric/issues), raise a feature request, and let us know what you need for your applications! Better yet, Nitric is Open Source, get involved and build it with us.
