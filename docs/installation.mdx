## Get the Nitric CLI

The Nitric CLI assists with most tasks you'll perform while developing with Nitric. You can use the CLI to create new projects and services, run a project locally, build a project for one or more providers and deploy your projects to the cloud.

### Step 1: Install CLI

Install the CLI using one of the options below:

<CodeExamples 
	languages={[
	{
		label: "NPM",
		value: "npm"
	},
	{
		label: "Windows",
		value: "win"
	}, {
		label: "macOS",
		value: "mac"
	}, {
		label: "Linux",
		value: "linux"
	}
	]}
	defaultLang="npm"
>
<CodeExample lang="npm">

```bash
npm install -g @nitric/cli
```

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"win"}>

```bash
TODO: Add windows binary install instructions
```

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"mac"}>

```bash
curl -o- -L https://nitric.io/install | bash
```

</CodeExample>
<CodeExample lang={"linux"}>

```bash
curl -o- -L https://nitric.io/install | bash
```

</CodeExample>
</CodeExamples>

### Step 2: Verify the installation

```bash
nitric
```

The output should be something like:

```bash
CLI tool for nitric applications

VERSION
  @nitric/cli/0.0.58 win32-x64 node-v14.17.0

USAGE
  $ nitric [COMMAND]

TOPICS

  build    build a project
  doctor   check environment for config and prerequisite software
  help     display help for nitric
  plugins  list installed plugins
  run      builds and runs a project locally for testing
```

### Step 3: Verify dependencies

The Nitric CLI depends on some other software for activities like building container images and deployment. You can verify that dependent software is installed using the `doctor` command. You'll be prompted to install any missing software.

```bash
nitric doctor
```

The output should be:

```bash
Doctor summary:
‚òÅÔ∏è pulumi
üê≥ docker
üöÄ setup a nitric repository

Good to go üëç Enjoy using Nitric üéâ
```
