# AWS Resources - Secrets

Nitric Secrets are implemented in AWS using [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).

## AWS Resources

- Secrets Manager Secrets
- IAM Policies

## Deployment

AWS Secrets Manager is service offered by AWS, there are no instances to deploy. As a result, Nitric's CLI only ensures the appropriate IAM policies and roles are in place to allow your Nitric Functions to access and store secrets.
